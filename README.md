# Cruise-Controller-for-a-car-PID-
Using Python to develop a Cruise Control for a car for a fixed set-point velocity by deploying a PID controller.

Given a desired velocity, aim is to drive the current velocity to the desired one with the help of a suitable controller. Here I have used a PID (Proportional Integral Derivative) Controller which is a control loop mechanism employing feedback that is widely used in industrial control systems and a variety of other applications requiring continuously modulated control.

A PID controller continuously calculates an error value {\displaystyle e(t)}e(t) as the difference between a desired setpoint (SP) and a measured process variable (PV) and applies a correction based on proportional, integral, and derivative terms (denoted P, I, and D respectively), hence the name.
